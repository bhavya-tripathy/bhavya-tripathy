### 🌻 about me

- 🎓 First-year B.Tech CSE @ Manipal University Jaipur (Class of 2029)  
- 📍 Currently studying Digital Logic, Engineering Maths, Python, and C  
- 🧠 Exploring where **engineering meets emotion**, and **code becomes art**  
- ✍️ Author of *The Sunflower Field* — a novel about grief, memory, and the ache of unfinished love  
- 🎧 Founder of *EchoRoom* — a Gen Z platform reimagining how we emotionally experience rock music  
- 🛠 I believe good tools feel like *poetry wrapped in logic* — intentional, timeless, and human

### 🧠 mindset & mission

> *"I want to build like a poet, think like an engineer, and live like a founder."*

- I don't just learn code — I learn to think **clearly, responsibly, and creatively**  
- I don't just build for functionality — I design with **emotion, memory, and intention**  
- Whether writing a novel or building a system, I aim to create work that *feels like truth*
