### 🧠 mindset & mission  

> *"I want to write with the honesty of a poet, think with the clarity of an engineer, and build with the courage of a founder."*  

- I don’t just code — I train my mind to **think deeply, precisely, and creatively**  
- I don’t just build systems — I craft them with **memory, emotion, and human intent**  
- My rulebook is simple: **move, build, create** — discipline in body, clarity in code, honesty in art  
- I treat college not as a degree, but as the **launchpad of an empire of ideas**  
- Whether it’s a novel, a startup, or research, I aim for work that feels **timeless, truthful, and alive**
