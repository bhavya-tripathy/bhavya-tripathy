### 🌼 about me

- 🎓 BTech CSE @ Manipal University Jaipur (Class of 2029)  
- 🧠 Exploring where **engineering meets emotion**, and where **art becomes system**
- ✍️ Author of *The Sunflower Field* – a novel about memory, grief, and things unsaid (in progress)  
- 🎧 Founder of *EchoRoom* – a platform reimagining how Gen Z connects with rock music through visuals, memory, and mood  
- 🛠️ I believe tools should feel like *poetry wrapped in logic* — beautiful, intentional, and useful

### 🎯 mission & mindset

> *“I want to build like a poet, think like an engineer, and live like a founder.”*

- I don’t just study syntax — I study **how to think clearly and build responsibly**  
- I don’t just write code — I write **narratives that compile into change**  
- Every keystroke, sketch, and feature is a quiet rebellion against mediocrity
